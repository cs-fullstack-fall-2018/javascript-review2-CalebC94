### Exercise 1
Ask the user for a number. If it’s positive, print “POSITIVE”. If it’s negative, print “NEGATIVE”. If it’s zero, print ZERO.

### Exercise 2
Print -10 through 5 using any loop.

### Exercise 3
In your main function, ask the user to input their favorite number. Alert the user of their favorite number. Create a function called ```aboveOrBelow100``` that alerts the user if their favorite number is above 100, below 100, or if it's equal alert It's 100!!!

### Exercise 4
Create an array with 5 numbers. Ask the user for the length of the array you want to print. Alert the user of the array from 0 to their input.

### Exercise 5
Given a main function:
```
String studentName = "Kenn" printName(studentName); 
```
Create a printName function to print "Hello" + studentName

### Exercise 6
Create a Movie class with the following attributes: movieName, rating, and yearReleased. Create a method printAllAttributes that will alert the user of the value of each attribute.

In your main function create two Movie objects, assign a value to each attribute, and print them to the console.

Remember, this is the basic model of a javascript file with a class
```javascript
class Movie{
  CLASS HERE
}

function main(){

}

main();
```

### Exercise 7
Create a class Dog. Make sure it has the attributes name, breed, color, gender. There are no methods in this class. The main function below should work with the class you create.
```javascript
class Dog{
  CLASS HERE
}

function main(){
	var newDog = new Dog("Fiddo", "Lab", "brown", "male");
	alert(newDog.name); 
	alert(newDog.breed);
	alert(newDog.color);
	alert(newDog.gender);
}

main();
```
